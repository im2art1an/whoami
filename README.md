# 👋 I'm Martian — I Build With AI

Most developers talk about AI.  
I use it to build things that actually work.

I design small, sharp tools — utilities, assistants, automations —  
the kind of things that save time, remove friction, and make life easier.

I don’t over-engineer. I don’t chase hype.  
I build what proves itself in real usage, and I delete everything else.

## What I Actually Do

- Build AI-powered microtools with real utility  
- Develop assistants and agent workflows  
- Create automation scripts that remove repetitive work  
- Prototype ideas in hours, not weeks  
- Explore every major AI tool, model, and workflow  
- Design simple browser-based AI apps (JS + Tailwind)  
- Experiment with 3D and interactive UIs using Three.js  

If a tool doesn’t reduce friction or save time,  
I don’t build it.

## My Relationship with AI Tools

I treat AI tools like a workshop — models, APIs, embeddings, agents, automations.

I’ve tested almost everything:
OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Llama, RAG frameworks, vector DBs, agent stacks, vision models, speech models, code models — if it exists, I’ve used it.

I don’t “learn tools.”  
I break them apart until I understand what they can’t do.  
That’s where the interesting ideas come from.

## What I'm Good At

- Turning ideas into working prototypes fast  
- Writing clean, minimal code in Python + JavaScript  
- Building things people actually use  
- Simplifying problems others overcomplicate  
- Using AI as leverage rather than decoration  

---

## Core Principles

- Ship fast  
- Keep it simple  
- Solve one problem at a time  
- Build only what proves its value  
- Use the right tool, not the popular tool  
- Never hide behind complexity

## What I'm Working On Now

- Personal AI assistants  
- Micro automations  
- Browser-based AI workflows  
- Small 3D AI-driven interfaces  
- A library of sharp, useful AI tools  

I’m not building for virality.  
I’m building for impact.

## The Short Version

I experiment with every AI tool I can find,  
I build things that actually work,  
and I keep going until life feels easier —  
for me and for anyone using my tools.
