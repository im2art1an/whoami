# whoami

`whoami` is a simple identity script and documentation file that returns a structured snapshot of who I am as a builder.  
It functions as a developer fingerprint — a clear, honest, and organized representation of what I do with AI tools, what I build, and how I think.

This repository includes:
- A machine-readable identity script (Python + JavaScript)
- A full written overview of my skills, focus areas, workflow, and AI capabilities
- A clear breakdown of the tools I use and the projects I create

# About Me

I am an AI Engineer who builds fast prototypes, useful automation tools, and experimental interfaces.  
My work focuses on clarity, speed, and simplicity — shipping small things that work rather than over-engineering large things that don't.

I work with:
- AI tools  
- Automation systems  
- Browser-based AI apps  
- JavaScript, Python, and lightweight frameworks  
- 3D and interactive UI concepts  

This repo consolidates everything I am building toward.

# What I Do with AI Tools

Below is a clear, structured list of my AI-related capabilities and workflows:

## AI Development
- Build AI-powered microtools and utilities  
- Create small assistants for automation and everyday tasks  
- Develop RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) helpers  
- Design AI agents with goal-driven workflows  
- Experiment with OpenAI, Claude, and Llama-based APIs  

## Automation
- Build scripts that automate repetitive tasks  
- Use AI for text cleanup, summarization, conversion, rewriting  
- Generate structured data from unstructured sources  
- Automate simple business workflows  

## App & Interface Development
