# 🧠 Martian — I Build With AI  
Most developers talk about AI. I use it to build things that actually work.

## 🚀 What I Actually Do

I design small, sharp tools — utilities, assistants, automations —  
the kind of things that save time, remove friction, and make life simpler.

- Build AI-powered microtools that solve one problem extremely well  
- Develop assistants and multi-step agent workflows  
- Create automation scripts that remove repetitive thinking  
- Prototype ideas in hours instead of weeks  
- Explore and push the limits of every major AI tool and model  
- Build simple browser-based AI apps (JavaScript + Tailwind)  
- Experiment with 3D and interactive UIs using Three.js  

> **If a tool doesn’t reduce friction or save time, I don’t build it.**

## 🧰 My Relationship With AI Tools

I treat AI tools like a workshop — models, embeddings, agents, APIs, automations.

I've tested almost everything:

**OpenAI · Claude · Gemini · Llama · RAG stacks · Vector DBs · Agent frameworks  
Vision models · Audio models · Code models · Local AI runtimes**

If it exists, I’ve used it.  
If it’s new, I’m already experimenting with it.

I don’t “learn tools.”  
I break them apart until I understand what they *can’t* do —  
that’s where the real ideas come from.

## ⚡ What I'm Good At

- Turning ideas into working prototypes fast  
- Writing clean, minimal code in Python + JavaScript  
- Building tools people actually use  
- Cutting complexity instead of adding it  
- Using AI as leverage — not decoration  

---

## 🧭 Core Principles

- **Ship fast**  
- **Keep it simple**  
- **Solve one problem at a time**  
- **Only build what proves its value**  
- **Use the right tool, not the trendy one**  
- **Never hide behind complexity**  

If it feels heavy, I cut it.  
If it feels confusing, I simplify it.

## 🔥 What I'm Working On Right Now

- Personal AI assistants  
- Micro automations that run independently  
- Browser-based AI workflows  
- Small 3D AI-driven interfaces  
- A library of sharp, useful AI tools  

I’m not building for virality.  
I’m building for **impact**.

## 🎯 The Short Version

**I experiment with every AI tool I can find.  
I build things that actually work.  
I keep going until life feels easier —  
for me and for anyone who uses my tools.**
