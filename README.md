# What I Actually Do

I build small, sharp AI tools — the kind that solve one problem extremely well.

My work is not theoretical.  
I ship fast, learn fast, and discard what doesn’t work.

I use AI the way it should be used:
- to automate boring things  
- to speed up thinking  
- to prototype ideas quickly  
- to create tools with immediate utility  

I don’t chase trends.  
I only build things that prove themselves in real usage.

# My Capabilities (Without Fluff)

## AI Engineering
- Build lightweight AI-powered microtools  
- Create personal assistants and agent workflows  
- Implement retrieval (RAG) systems for fast knowledge access  
- Use LLMs to automate decisions, writing, structuring, and filtering  
- Combine APIs with simple scripts to produce real output, fast  

## Development
- Browser-based AI apps (HTML/JS/Tailwind)  
- 3D interface prototypes (Three.js)  
- Automation scripts in Python + Node  
- Clean, readable code without unnecessary complexity  

## Execution
- Turn ideas into working prototypes in hours, not weeks  
- Strip problems down to essentials  
- Build for clarity and speed, not corporate over-engineering  

If a tool doesn't reduce friction or save time, I don't build it.

# Core Philosophy

My engineering philosophy fits in six lines:

- Ship fast  
- Keep it simple  
- Solve one thing at a time  
- Let results define direction  
- Only build what is actually used  
- Never hide behind complexity  

If it feels heavy, I cut it.  
If it feels confusing, I simplify it.  
If it feels useless, I delete it.
