### ⚡ *Most developers talk about AI. I use it to build things that actually work.*

## 🚀 What I Actually Do

I design **small, sharp tools** — utilities, assistants, automations —  
the kind that save time, remove friction, and make life simpler.

- Build AI-powered microtools that solve one problem extremely well  
- Develop assistants & agent workflows  
- Create automations that eliminate repetitive thinking  
- Prototype ideas in hours instead of weeks  
- Push the limits of every major AI tool, model, and workflow  
- Build browser-based AI apps (JavaScript + Tailwind)  
- Experiment with 3D interactive UIs using Three.js  

> **If a tool doesn't reduce friction or save time, I don’t build it.**

## 🧰 My Relationship With AI Tools

I treat AI tools like a workshop — models, embeddings, agents, runtimes, APIs, automations.

I’ve tested nearly everything:  
**OpenAI · Claude · Gemini · Llama · RAG stacks · Vector DBs  
Agents · Vision models · Speech models · Code models · Local runtimes**

I don’t “learn tools.”  
I break them apart until I understand what they *can’t* do —  
that’s where the real ideas come from.

## ⚡ What I'm Good At

- Turning ideas into working prototypes fast  
- Writing clean, minimal Python + JavaScript  
- Building tools real people actually use  
- Cutting complexity instead of adding it  
- Using AI as leverage, not decoration

## 🧭 Core Principles

<div align="center">

🟣 **Ship fast**  
🔵 **Keep it simple**  
🟢 **Solve one problem at a time**  
🟡 **Only build what proves its value**  
🔴 **Use the right tool, not the trendy one**  
⚫ **Never hide behind complexity**

</div>

If it feels heavy, I cut it.  
If it feels confusing, I simplify it.

## 🔥 What I'm Building Now

- Personal AI assistants  
- Micro-automations that run independently  
- Browser-based AI workflows  
- 3D AI-driven interfaces  
- A library of sharp, useful AI tools  

I'm not building for virality.  
I'm building for **impact**.
